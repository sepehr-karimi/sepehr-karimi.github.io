Starting in January 2024, I joined Columbia University as a **Research Assistant** under the mentorship of **Dr. Maryam Zolnoori**. Our research focuses on **leveraging large language models (LLMs)** for clinical decision support, with the ultimate goal of developing real-time diagnostic tools for healthcare.

This experience has been incredibly fulfilling, allowing me to explore how AI can make a real difference in clinical settings. It's amazing to work on projects that have the potential to save lives and improve patient care.
