In February 2024, I joined Nottingham Trent University as a **Research Assistant**, working under the guidance of **David Brown, Mufti Mahmud, Alexander Sumich, and Nadja Heym**. Our project involves conducting a systematic review of **deep learning approaches on EEG** data for the early detection of **Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)**.

Collaborating with such an interdisciplinary team has broadened my perspective on how AI and neuroscience can converge to tackle critical healthcare challenges.
