A significant milestone for SofiaMind was securing **our first major client, the University of Tehran**, in March 2024. We successfully deployed a **chatbot system** to handle various university services, from answering student inquiries to assisting with administrative tasks.

The chatbot is now fully operational, providing support across multiple departments. We are committed to maintaining and improving this system to ensure a seamless experience for both students and staff. This achievement marks the beginning of SofiaMind's expansion into the education sector.
