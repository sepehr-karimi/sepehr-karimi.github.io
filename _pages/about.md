## **About Me**

I recently got my **Master's degree in Computer Engineering** at the [ECE School of the University of Tehran](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/ece), Iran. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**, and **Social Network Analysis**. I am a **research assistant** at the Social Networks Laboratory, where I work under the mentorship of [Dr. Masoud Asadpour](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MKwwcvIAAAAJ&hl=en). My thesis focuses on *Retweet Prediction using Graph Neural Networks and Representation Learning*, aiming to predict user interactions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter).

In addition to my academic endeavors, I am actively engaged in various collaborative research projects with universities like **Columbia University** and **Nottingham Trent University**. These projects explore advanced topics in clinical decision support using **large language models (LLMs)** and early detection of **Alzheimer’s Disease** using EEG and deep learning techniques.

<!-- ### **Professional Highlights**
- **Co-Founder and AI Engineer** at SofiaMind Chatbot, where I integrate cutting-edge NLP models for real-time conversational AI.
- **Data Scientist** at OptiGrid Pty Ltd, working on energy optimization through advanced data modeling and backend development. -->
