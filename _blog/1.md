Starting a company has always been a dream of mine, and in September 2023, that dream came true when I co-founded **SofiaMind**. Our vision was to create intelligent chatbots leveraging state-of-the-art AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

SofiaMind aims to transform how organizations handle customer queries by delivering **accurate, context-aware, and real-time responses**. The journey has been exciting and challenging, and I couldn't be more proud of what we've built so far.

Stay tuned for updates as we grow SofiaMind into a leader in AI-powered chatbot solutions.
