⚡ I am excited to share that I have officially started my **PhD** at the **University of Adelaide**, supported through a **National Industry PhD Project** in collaboration with **OptiGrid Pty Ltd**.

This project — *Smarter Batteries for a Smarter Grid* — aims to address a key challenge in the **Australian National Electricity Market (NEM)**:

## 🔋 Research Focus

My PhD aims to develop a **unified, end-to-end machine learning framework** that:

- Integrates domain expertise from the Australian energy sector  
- Optimizes BESS operation under real-world NEM conditions  
- Demonstrates how ML-driven approaches can improve both **battery revenues** and **grid reliability**

---

## 🌱 Why This Matters

A smart, integrated approach to BESS operation can unlock:

- Stronger business cases for new utility-scale battery projects  
- Better returns from existing storage assets  
- Faster and more cost-effective progress toward **Australia’s net-zero goals**  
- A more efficient NEM and potentially **lower electricity costs** for consumers  

This research sits at the intersection of **machine learning**, **energy economics**, and **power systems engineering** — fields that must converge to support the future of Australia’s clean energy transition.
