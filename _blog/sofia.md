Starting a company has always been a dream of mine, and in September 2023, I co-founded **SofiaMind** with a few talented students at University of Tehran. Our vision was to create intelligent chatbots leveraging state-of-the-art AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

SofiaMind aims to transform how organizations handle customer queries by delivering **accurate, context-aware, and real-time responses**. The experience we gained during the start of Sofiamind was exciting, although the process was really challenging.
