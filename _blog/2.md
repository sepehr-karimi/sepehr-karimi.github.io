In October 2023, I began working remotely with **OptiGrid Pty Ltd**, an Australian company focused on energy optimization solutions. My role involves building **APIs for data-driven decision-making** and performing **data analysis and modeling** to enhance system efficiency.

Remote work has been an enriching experience, allowing me to collaborate across time zones and contribute to cutting-edge solutions in energy technology. It's exciting to see how data science can make a tangible impact in sustainable energy.
